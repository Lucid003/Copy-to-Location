# Copy to Location
Script for copying folders from a source location to a destination

Uses easygui to allow uers to select a source folder, a destination folder, and either all files or specific file types, 
and then copies files from source folder to destination folder if the files are of the selected file type and do
not exist at the destination location. Does not copy folders inside of source folder.

I created this script because my employer is copying audio recordings from individual computers to a network storage location
and I wanted practice automating the process. This should work for network locations, but I have not tested it as of yet, so that'll 
be in the next update.
